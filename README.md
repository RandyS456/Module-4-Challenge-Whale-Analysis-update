# Module-4-Challenge-Whale-Analysis-update
Challenge: Whale Analysis update 2nd submit- In this challenge, we get to use our new python, pandas and matplot skills to create a tool that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across various areas and determine which portfolio outperformed the others.
We just learned these quantitative analysis techniques with Python and Pandas, and we want to determine which portfolio is performing the best across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.
We will be given the historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from the firm's algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from the big hedge and mutual funds. We will then use this analysis to create a custom portfolio of stocks and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market (S&P 500 IndexLinks to an external site.).
